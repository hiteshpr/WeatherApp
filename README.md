# WeatherApp

A intuitive app made in Angular 2 and then shifted to Angular 4.
It detects the user's location or user can add different location names in the text box provided. 
The text box is autofill and provides suggestion.
The App then displays all the weather information like temperature, wind, humidity etc and also displays forcast for the next 5 days.

For accessing the weather data, OpenWeatherMap's REST APIs are used.
